# Amos Model Fit
============================

This AMOS plugin simplifies the process to check model fit measures. Normally a check requires the user to view various output windows to check model fitness. This plugin also gives recommendations based on currently accepted practices.

Installation
------------
Download `Amos-ModelFit.dll` file from [this repository's releases](https://github.com/john-lim/Amos-MasterValidity/blob/master/Amos-ModelFit/obj/Debug/Amos-ModelFit.dll).
When the download completes, copy the dll into AMOS' `Plugins\` directory, which is normally located in 
`C:\Users\{accountName}\AppData\Local\AMOSDevelopment\AMOS\{AMOSVersion}\Plugins`. The `AppData` folder is hidden by default, but you can access it by either typing in the path directly or showing hidden files.
Restart AMOS, and the plugin should then show under the 'Plugins' menu in AMOS.

Usage
-----
In AMOS, build your model with desired number of variables. Run the plugin under the plugin menu and the html file pops up in your default browser.
